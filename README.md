# Tartis

Tartis is a lightweight Tetris clone that runs entirely in the browser.

## Playing

Open [index.html](index.html) or visit the project's GitHub Pages site to play.

## Development

All logic is contained in [tetris.js](tetris.js) and the markup lives in
[index.html](index.html). No build tools or external dependencies are required.

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

1. In your repository settings, open **Pages**.
2. Select the `main` branch and `/` root as the source.
3. Save the settings and after a few minutes the game will be accessible at
