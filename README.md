# Tartis

Tartis is a small Tetris clone with a modern feel written in Python using the
Pygame library. The game features simple graphics, score tracking, and the next
piece preview.

## Requirements

- Python 3.12 or compatible version
- `pygame` package

You can install Pygame with:

```bash
pip install pygame
```

## Running the Game

Execute the following command from the repository directory:

```bash
python tetris.py
```

Use the arrow keys to move and rotate the pieces. Close the window to exit the
game.

## Play Online

A simplified version of Tartis is available through GitHub Pages. Open `index.html` from the repository or visit the project page if hosted. The browser version is written in JavaScript so no installation is required.

Use the arrow keys to control the falling pieces just like the desktop version.
